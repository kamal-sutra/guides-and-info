# Sending Tokens with Keplr

*The most basic yet essential wallet function explained.*

**1. To send tokens from your wallet to another, open the Keplr extension menu and select your chain from the drop-down menu at the top.**

*Note: this only covers regular token transfers to another wallet on the same chain. IBC transfers between blockcains will be covered in another guide!*

**2. Select [[send]] to open the menu and see further options. 
The [[deposit]] button here is where you can find your wallet address, either in plain text or QR code format.**

**3. Enter the address to send the tokens to, and select the token to be sent. If a memo is required, enter that in the third text box - this is typically used for deposits to centralised exchanges.**

*Avoid manually typing wallet addresses. Copy and paste is ideal to make sure your tokens get to where you want them to be.*

You can usually send any token in the wallet this way, as long as it is within the same network. (From one "osmo1..." address to another "osmo1..." address)

If a CEX requires a memo and you deposit tokens without one, your tokens may be lost! Follow their instructions carefully.**

**4. Enter the amount to send and the amount fee to pay. The speed (and sometimes success) of your transaction may depend on your selection of fee.**

*None. Remember to save a small amount of tokens for this as well as future transactions!*

**5. If you click on Advanced under the Fee settings, you will see some extra options. You can choose to pay transaction fees with a different token.**

It also has the option to increase the gas amount - helpful for those 'out of gas' errors.

*Note: When increasing gas, the fee will also rise. Be careful!*

**6. After you've confirmed (and double-checked!) the info, simply hit [[approve]] and wait for confirmation of success. If you reject the transaction, no fee will be taken.**
